=================================
The KBUS documentation and sphinx
=================================

Pre-built documentation
-----------------------
For your comfort and convenience, a pre-built version of the KBus
documentation is available at:

    http://html.kbus.googlecode.com/hg/docs/html/index.html

or within the Mercurial ``web`` repository at:

    ``docs/html/index.html``

Building the documentation
--------------------------
The KBus documentation is built using Sphinx_.

.. note:: It needs (at least) version 0.6 of Sphinx.  Recent versions of
	Ubuntu provide this in the ``python-sphinx`` package; on older
	versions you should use ``easy_install`` as described on the
	Sphinx website.


You also need graphviz (which provides ``dot``).

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

With luck, the HTML in the ``web`` repository will be up-to-date, and
you won't need to (re)build the documentation. However, if you should need to
(for instance, because you've updated it),
just use the Makefile::

    make html

Note that the ``html`` repository includes ``default`` as a
*subrepository*; this means that if you've made changes to the doc source
anywhere else, you have to update the subrepository before you build in
``html``, probably with a line like this::

    hg -R kbus pull <repo>
    hg -R kbus update

KBUS developers can push rebuilt docs back to Mercurial in the usual way;
beware that the ``inheritance`` graphic is rebuilt every time and require 
``hg add`` (and, ideally, the old ones removed).


The Python bindings
-------------------
Read the ``kbus-python-*.txt`` files to see how individual classes and
functions within kbus.py are documented. Obviously, if you add, remove or
rename such, you may need to alter these files -- please do so appropriately.

Mime type magic
---------------
In order for the documentation in the Google Code Mercurial repository to be
useable as documentation, the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files in the docs/html
directory tree need to have the correct mime types. Mercurial is clever
enough to be able to cope with this, though Subversion needed extra help.

Mercurial gotchas
-----------------
Sphinx believes that the contents of ``docs`` are transitory - i.e., that it
is free to delete them if it wishes. In particular, ``make clean`` will delete
all of the contents of ``docs``.

Meanwhile, we've committed ``docs/html`` and its contents to Mercurial.

This used to be a problem under Subversion, but is no longer since moving
to Mercurial. If you accidentally ``make clean`` the docs away, you can
use ``hg checkout`` to retrieve them.
With luck the dependency tracking in the ``make`` process will cope.
