This is a version of the KBUS kernel module code that I have been using for
kernel submission. It will at some point be merged into the main repository aa
thttp://code.google.com/p/kbus/, specifically into the
https://code.google.com/p/kbus.kernel/ repository.

The branches (1-no-tragic through 5-no-rw and then master itself) were used in
producing the patches submitted to the LKML - see
http://lwn.net/Articles/434361/.

The homepage for KBUS as a whole is at http://kbus-messaging.org/.
